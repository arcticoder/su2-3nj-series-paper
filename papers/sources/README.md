# Source LaTeX Masters (Upstream)

This folder contains *copies* of the primary LaTeX masters from the implementation repositories, staged here to support the merge into the hub paper draft.

Do not edit these files directly unless you intend to sync changes back upstream.

## Provenance

- `closedform.tex` → `su2-3nj-closedform/A Closed-Form Hypergeometric Product Formula for General SU(2) 3nj Recoupling Coefficients.tex`
- `uniform-closed-form.tex` → `su2-3nj-uniform-closed-form/Universal Closed-Form Hypergeometric Representation of SU(2) 3nj Symbols.tex`
- `recurrences.tex` → `su2-3nj-recurrences/Closed-Form Finite Recurrences for SU(2) 3nj Symbols.tex`
- `generating-functional.tex` → `su2-3nj-generating-functional/A Universal Generating Functional for SU(2) 3nj Symbols.tex`
- `node-matrix-elements.tex` → `su2-node-matrix-elements/Closed-Form Matrix Elements for Arbitrary-Valence SU(2) Nodes via Generating Functionals.tex`
