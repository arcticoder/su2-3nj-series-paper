# SU(2) 3n-j Series — Cross-Repo TODO (Q1–Q2 2026)

Date: 2026-01-18

## At-a-glance status

- **Repos with pytest**: 5/5  
  Progress: `██████████` (100%) — **~157 unit tests** (per-repo) + **integration/reference checks** (see note below)
- **Hub integration harness**: 21/21 checks passing (incl. 9j + 12j references)  
  Progress: `██████████` (100%)
- **Node-matrix baseline parity (N0–N5)**: ✅ complete (15 tests + scripts + artifacts)
  Progress: `██████████` (100%)
- **Recurrences implementation (R1-R3)**: ✅ complete (18 tests + stability reports)
  Progress: `██████████` (100%)
- **Node-matrix physics parity (N6+)**: ✅ N6 complete (9 tests, derivative API for k≤4)
  Progress: `██████░░░░` (60%) — derivative-based API prototype operational
- **Master paper**: ✅ Zenodo-ready; 🔄 arXiv-endorsement polish in progress (currently ~18 pages with standard 1in margins)
- **Main remaining work**: consistency/polish pass + arXiv submission packaging

**Notes (important for arXiv polish)**
- **Test-count inconsistency to resolve**: the paper currently says **161** tests, while historical docs reported **188**; the auto-generated validation summary table currently reports **191 total checks**. This needs to be reconciled and then made consistent across paper + docs.

> **📋 Detailed completion history**: See [SU2-TODO-completed.md](SU2-TODO-completed.md) for full task archive

This TODO is the cross-repository execution plan for the SU(2) 3n-j series:

- `su2-3nj-closedform`
- `su2-3nj-uniform-closed-form`
- `su2-3nj-recurrences`
- `su2-3nj-generating-functional`
- `su2-node-matrix-elements`

The goal is to turn the existing (already substantial) derivations + scripts into a **rigorous, reproducible, publication-ready package** (2–3 paper series or one 20–30 page JMP-style paper) with:

- Clear assumptions/edge cases (half-integers, triangle/parity constraints, large spins)
- Verified identities and cross-checks (SymPy Wigner, independent implementations, numeric vs exact)
- Reproducible reference datasets and deterministic scripts
- Tight narrative: closed forms → uniform form → finite recurrences → generating functional → node matrix elements

---

## Phase 2 (Integration + Publication Prep)

With core implementations and validations in place for most repos, shift to **integration, advanced testing, and publication prep**.

Priority order:
1. **Close remaining parity gaps**: `su2-node-matrix-elements` (upgrade placeholder API; expand tests; expand stability sweeps)
2. **Cross-repo integration**: keep `scripts/run_integration_tests.py` authoritative; extend summary + higher-n spot checks
3. **Higher-n validations**: 12j/15j sampling + UQ/stability sweeps (where implementations exist)
4. **Packaging**: arXiv-ready LaTeX bundle + reproducible artifact regeneration

---

## Phase 3 (arXiv / Zenodo endorsement polish)

The master paper is already strong enough for Zenodo (low-friction preprint), but arXiv endorsement-readiness benefits from **extra completeness, consistency, and reproducibility polish**.

Target readiness:
- **Zenodo**: ~80–90% (ship after quick consistency fixes)
- **arXiv**: ~70% (ship after polish items below)

### A1 — Resolve inconsistencies (counts, links, metadata)
Actions:
- Recompute and lock the test/check counts:
  - per-repo pytest totals
  - hub integration harness checks
  - higher-n reference checks
- Update all occurrences consistently:
  - paper abstract + validation section
  - this TODO
  - any README “status” blocks
- Ensure GitHub URLs in the paper point to `DawsonInstitute/*` (no legacy org/user links).

Acceptance criteria:
- Paper + TODO agree on the same numbers (or the paper uses a stable phrasing like “over 190 checks” and points to the generated report).

### A2 — Make generated validation tables arXiv-proof
Problem: auto-generated LaTeX can break builds (e.g., underscores) and some expressions render as raw SymPy strings (e.g., `sqrt(5)` instead of `\sqrt{5}`).

Actions:
- Harden `scripts/generate_validation_tables.py`:
  - escape LaTeX special chars in text fields (descriptions, method names)
  - render exact expressions via `sympy.latex(sympify(...))` when possible
- Regenerate `papers/paper/validation-tables.tex` and ensure `latexmk` succeeds cleanly.

Acceptance criteria:
- No LaTeX build errors from generated tables; expressions render as proper math.

### A3 — Add explicit half-integer example (visible in paper)
Problem: half-integer support is claimed, but a reader should see at least one explicit half-integer value in a table or short inline example.

Actions:
- Add a dedicated half-integer 6j example to the validation tables and/or the validation section.
- Ensure the example is cross-checked against SymPy (symbolic exact match).

Acceptance criteria:
- Paper includes an explicit half-integer numeric/exact example and a stated validation route.

### A4 — Add algorithm/pseudocode blocks (reader-facing completeness)
Actions:
- Add short pseudocode/algorithm sketches for:
  - matching-number computation route (e.g., Pfaffian for planar graphs; otherwise “external routine”)
  - recurrence solve strategy (forward/backward + normalization)
- Keep them compact and implementation-neutral.

Acceptance criteria:
- A motivated reader can reproduce the computational pipeline without reverse-engineering code.

### A5 — Add explicit limitations + failure examples
Actions:
- Include 1–2 explicit failure-mode examples (e.g., near-singular determinant; recurrence instability threshold) and show what the diagnostic looks like.

Acceptance criteria:
- Paper states not just “unstable for large $j$” but also a concrete, checkable example.

### A6 — Optional figures (nice-to-have for arXiv)
Actions:
- Add 1–2 small figures from existing sweeps:
  - recurrence stability vs spin
  - determinant condition number vs spin/topology

Acceptance criteria:
- Figures are generated by script; arXiv bundle includes the images.

### A7 — arXiv + Zenodo packaging
Actions:
- Create an arXiv-ready bundle checklist:
  - all `\input{}` files included
  - `.bib` included and citations resolve
  - figures included
  - clean build from scratch
- Optionally add a script to produce a submission `.tar.gz` from a clean tree.

Acceptance criteria:
- `latexmk` works from a clean build directory; a bundle can be uploaded without manual fixes.

Scope note: for `su2-node-matrix-elements`, implement a *minimal, deterministic* computational entrypoint first (even if initially a placeholder), with clear hedging and tests that verify invariants, stability reporting, and cross-checks against independent numeric/symbolic backends.

---

## 0) High-level deliverables

### D0.1 — Reproducible validation harness (code + data)
Acceptance criteria:
- Each repo that claims a formula has a **single command** that regenerates key tables/figures and checks invariants.
- Reference datasets are versioned (JSON/CSV) and regenerated deterministically.
- CI/pytest-friendly test entrypoints exist where Python code exists.

### D0.2 — Paper-ready “master draft” (series bundle)
Preferred: a series of 2–3 papers, or one comprehensive paper.

Acceptance criteria:
- A master LaTeX build exists that can be compiled in one shot.
- Common notation is unified (spin conventions, parity rules, graph notation).
- One shared bibliography (BibTeX) with 5–10 core priors.

### D0.3 — Q2 2026 submission readiness
Acceptance criteria:
- All claims in the abstract/introduction have corresponding lemmas/propositions and at least one validation route.
- Limitations are explicit (numerical instability regimes, unsupported topologies, etc.).

---

## Dependencies (what blocks what)

Use this as the “critical path” map when choosing the next task.

- **T5 (integration harness)** depends on: repo installability + stable public APIs across all repos (especially node-matrix N0–N5).
- **T4 (stability/UQ sweeps)** depends on: deterministic reference generation (T2) + stable evaluation entrypoints.
- **P2 (master LaTeX merge)** is complete; future paper updates that rely on **node-matrix numerical claims** should depend on: N6+ (derivative-based API path) and T5 (so the paper can cite a single authoritative validation report).
- **P4 (validation section + tables)** depends on: T2 (goldens) + T4 (stability CSV/JSON) + T5 (integration report).
- **D0.3 (submission readiness)** depends on: P2–P4 + a clean “build from scratch” workflow (arXiv packaging).

---

## 1) Cross-repo technical tasks (highest leverage)

### T1 — Standardize spin domain/validation across code
Problem: half-integer spins and selection rules are common failure points.

Actions:
- Implement a shared “spin validation” policy in each repo that has Python:
  - Validate that each spin is integer or half-integer: $2j \in \mathbb{Z}$.
  - Enforce triangle inequalities and parity constraints where applicable.
  - Ensure summation bounds are computed **exactly** (avoid `int()` truncation).
- Add tests that explicitly include half-integer cases, e.g. $j=1/2, 3/2$.

Acceptance criteria:
- A half-integer dataset passes for 6j and 9j where supported.

### T2 — Deterministic “golden reference” datasets
Actions:
- Create/update canonical JSON datasets per repo:
  - 6j dataset (small spins + half-integers)
  - 9j dataset (small spins)
  - Optional: decompositions (9j→6j sums) where available
- Add scripts to regenerate references with pinned rules:
  - exact rational mode
  - numeric mode (float) with explicit tolerances

Acceptance criteria:
- Tests compare against golden datasets without network access.

### T3 — Cross-verification matrix (what checks what)
Build a table mapping:
- Formula → Implementation A → Implementation B → identity/invariant

Example checks:
- Closed form vs SymPy (`wigner_6j`, `wigner_9j`)
- Racah-summation implementation vs SymPy
- Recurrence reconstruction vs direct evaluation
- Generating functional coefficients vs direct Wigner values

Acceptance criteria:
- At least 2 independent routes validate each key claim.

### T4 — Numerical stability & UQ hooks
Actions:
- Add a simple, consistent UQ protocol:
  - sweep over spin ranges
  - track condition numbers / determinant stability (for generating functional)
  - compare rational vs numeric evaluation

Acceptance criteria:
- A “stability report” script produces a CSV/JSON summary.

### T5 — Cross-repo integration harness
Actions:
- Create a unified “hub” repo that can:
  - import from `su2-3nj-closedform`, `su2-3nj-uniform-closed-form`, `su2-3nj-recurrences`, `su2-3nj-generating-functional`, `su2-node-matrix-elements`
  - run an end-to-end validation command (single entrypoint)
- Add higher-n spot checks (e.g., 12j/15j) using high precision (mpmath 50 dps) where applicable.
- Add higher-n spot checks:
  - ✅ 9j: deterministic reference dataset + harness checks
  - 🔄 12j/15j: add once a specific topology/kind is chosen (see Institutional plan below)

Acceptance criteria:
- One command runs the full validation suite + produces a summary report.

---

## 2) Paper bundling / publication tasks

### P1 — Decide bundling (2–3 papers) vs single JMP draft
Suggested 3-paper arc:
1) Closed-form + uniform hypergeometric representation
2) Finite recurrences + algorithms/stability
3) Generating functionals + arbitrary-valence node matrix elements

Alternative single paper title:
- “Unified Closed-Form Representations and Generating Functionals for SU(2) 3n-j Recoupling Coefficients.”

Acceptance criteria:
- A single outline exists with section allocation and cross-references.

### P2 — Master LaTeX merge
Actions:
- Identify source LaTeX masters (per repo):
  - closed-form: `A Closed-Form Hypergeometric Product Formula for General SU(2) 3nj Recoupling Coefficients.tex`
  - uniform: `Universal Closed-Form Hypergeometric Representation of SU(2) 3nj Symbols.tex`
  - recurrences: `Closed-Form Finite Recurrences for SU(2) 3nj Symbols.tex`
  - generating functional: `A Universal Generating Functional for SU(2) 3nj Symbols.tex`
  - node matrix elements: `Closed-Form Matrix Elements for Arbitrary-Valence SU(2) Nodes via Generating Functionals.tex`
- Create a master tree (new repo recommended, e.g. `su2-3nj-series-paper/`) with:
  - shared macros
  - shared bibliography
  - appendices for proofs and code

Acceptance criteria:
- One `latexmk` command builds the full PDF.

### P3 — Literature integration (priors)
Actions:
- Add a “Related Work” section with BibTeX entries and explicit positioning.
- Integrate already-downloaded priors in `energy/papers/related/` into the bib.

Acceptance criteria:
- 5–10 relevant priors cited in intro + comparisons.

### P4 — Validation section + tables
Actions:
- Add a dedicated validation section:
  - known values (3j/6j)
  - random small-spin sampling (6j/9j)
  - identities (Biedenharn–Elliott, orthogonality)
  - recurrence cross-checks

Acceptance criteria:
- Tables/figures are reproducibly generated by scripts committed in repos.

---

## 5) “Start here” checklist (fastest path to momentum)

This checklist is intentionally end-to-end: it gets a fresh checkout from “works locally” → “validated” → “paper artifacts build” without guessing what’s missing.

1) Run unit tests in all 5 repos (local parity check).
  - Goal: `python -m pytest` passes everywhere (no skipped critical suites).

2) Run the hub integration harness.
  - Goal: `scripts/run_integration_tests.py` passes and regenerates `data/integration_validation_report.json`.

3) Regenerate deterministic reference artifacts (goldens + stability reports).
  - Goal: reference JSON/CSV regeneration scripts run cleanly and match committed outputs (or match up to explicitly-allowed metadata fields).

4) Close the remaining “fifth repo parity” gap (`su2-node-matrix-elements`).
  - If N0–N5 are complete: implement N6 (finite-difference derivative prototype for k=4) + add tests + add a stability sweep.
  - If any of N0–N5 are incomplete in your working tree: complete them first (package layout, minimal API, tests, reference JSON, stability JSON, one-command workflow).
  - Quick sanity commands (inside that repo): `python -m pytest`, then run `scripts/generate_reference_tables.py` and `scripts/generate_stability_report.py`.

5) Expand T5 reporting (visibility).
  - Add repo-level rollups to the integration report (counts, versions, artifact paths).

6) Advance T2 higher-n spot checks (12j/15j).
  - Goal: small curated cases at high precision (mpmath 50 dps) with explicit “not supported yet” handling if a route is missing.

7) Build the paper from scratch (clean LaTeX build).
  - Goal: one-command build that runs BibTeX and yields the final PDF.

8) Ensure the paper’s validation section is sourced from artifacts.
  - Goal: tables/figures are generated from `data/` outputs with pinned scripts.

9) Create an arXiv submission bundle.
  - Goal: a minimal `.tar.gz` that compiles on arXiv’s TeX stack without manual steps.

10) Update this TODO immediately after each milestone.
  - Keep the “At-a-glance status” block accurate.

   - Finite-difference source derivative for k≤4 valence
   - 24 tests passing (15 baseline + 9 N6)
   - Stability comparison report generated

2. **arXiv Submission Package**
   - Create `.tar.gz` bundle that compiles on arXiv's TeX stack

   - N7+: Higher valence derivative support (k=5, k=6)

---

## Institutional-quality next steps (DawsonInstitute spotlight)

These are the next tasks to upgrade this work from “publication-ready” to “transfer-ready + rigor-forward.”

### I1 — Higher-n validations (12j/15j) integrated end-to-end
Status: ✅ 12j COMPLETE | 15j deferred (specialized)

Goal: add 5–7 curated 12j and 15j spot checks at high precision and surface them in both the harness JSON and the paper appendix.

Accomplishments:
- ✅ 12j symbols: implemented via standard 6j decomposition (Varshalovich et al.)
- ✅ Generated deterministic JSON references: `data/higher_n_reference_12j.json` (6 cases, mp.dps=50)
- ✅ Integrated into harness: `scripts/run_integration_tests.py` validates all 12j cases (6/6 PASS)
- ✅ Paper appendix: `generate_validation_tables.py` produces 12j reference table

Notes:
- 15j symbols are highly specialized and require explicit coupling scheme definitions.
- Deferred as future work pending specific physics use case or request.

### I2 — Paper polish for reproducibility
Status: ✅ COMPLETE

Actions:
- ✅ Added reproducibility appendix: `papers/paper/appendix-reproducibility.tex`
  - Exact commands for environment setup + package installation
  - Per-repo and cross-repo validation workflows
  - Artifact regeneration paths
  - Glossary/notation table
- ✅ All cross-references compile cleanly
- ✅ Validation tables auto-generated from `data/` JSON artifacts

### I3 — Node-matrix stability/UQ follow-up (higher valence)
Status: 🔄 DEFERRED (N7 prerequisite)

Actions:
- Extend derivative-based stability sweep to valence $k>4$ once N7 is implemented.
- Record regimes where finite differences become ill-conditioned.

Note: N7 (extending derivative API to k=5, k=6) is optional; can be completed as future work if needed.

### I4 — Transfer readiness audit
Status: ✅ COMPLETE

Actions:
- ✅ LICENSE consistency: All 6 repos now use the MIT license (Copyright © 2026 Dawson Institute)
- ✅ README uniformity: All 6 repos have README.md files
- ✅ No hard-coded absolute paths in hub repo scripts/docs (scan confirmed clean)
