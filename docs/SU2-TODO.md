# SU(2) 3n-j Series — Cross-Repo TODO (Q1–Q2 2026)

Date: 2026-01-18

This TODO is the cross-repository execution plan for the SU(2) 3n-j series:

- `su2-3nj-closedform`
- `su2-3nj-uniform-closed-form`
- `su2-3nj-recurrences`
- `su2-3nj-generating-functional`
- `su2-node-matrix-elements`

The goal is to turn the existing (already substantial) derivations + scripts into a **rigorous, reproducible, publication-ready package** (2–3 paper series or one 20–30 page JMP-style paper) with:

- Clear assumptions/edge cases (half-integers, triangle/parity constraints, large spins)
- Verified identities and cross-checks (SymPy Wigner, independent implementations, numeric vs exact)
- Reproducible reference datasets and deterministic scripts
- Tight narrative: closed forms → uniform form → finite recurrences → generating functional → node matrix elements

---

## Phase 2 (Integration + Publication Prep)

With core implementations and validations in place for most repos, shift to **integration, advanced testing, and publication prep**.

Priority order:
1. **Lagging repo**: `su2-node-matrix-elements` (tests, stability, reference tables)
2. **Cross-repo integration**: new unified hub repo for code + papers
3. **Higher-n validations**: 12j/15j sampling + UQ/stability sweeps
4. **Paper bundling**: master LaTeX + shared bib + reproducible tables/figures

Scope note: for `su2-node-matrix-elements`, implement a *minimal, deterministic* computational entrypoint first (even if initially a placeholder), with clear hedging and tests that verify invariants, stability reporting, and cross-checks against independent numeric/symbolic backends.

---

## 0) High-level deliverables

### D0.1 — Reproducible validation harness (code + data)
Acceptance criteria:
- Each repo that claims a formula has a **single command** that regenerates key tables/figures and checks invariants.
- Reference datasets are versioned (JSON/CSV) and regenerated deterministically.
- CI/pytest-friendly test entrypoints exist where Python code exists.

### D0.2 — Paper-ready “master draft” (series bundle)
Preferred: a series of 2–3 papers, or one comprehensive paper.

Acceptance criteria:
- A master LaTeX build exists that can be compiled in one shot.
- Common notation is unified (spin conventions, parity rules, graph notation).
- One shared bibliography (BibTeX) with 5–10 core priors.

### D0.3 — Q2 2026 submission readiness
Acceptance criteria:
- All claims in the abstract/introduction have corresponding lemmas/propositions and at least one validation route.
- Limitations are explicit (numerical instability regimes, unsupported topologies, etc.).

---

## 1) Cross-repo technical tasks (highest leverage)

### T1 — Standardize spin domain/validation across code
Problem: half-integer spins and selection rules are common failure points.

Actions:
- Implement a shared “spin validation” policy in each repo that has Python:
  - Validate that each spin is integer or half-integer: $2j \in \mathbb{Z}$.
  - Enforce triangle inequalities and parity constraints where applicable.
  - Ensure summation bounds are computed **exactly** (avoid `int()` truncation).
- Add tests that explicitly include half-integer cases, e.g. $j=1/2, 3/2$.

Acceptance criteria:
- A half-integer dataset passes for 6j and 9j where supported.

### T2 — Deterministic “golden reference” datasets
Actions:
- Create/update canonical JSON datasets per repo:
  - 6j dataset (small spins + half-integers)
  - 9j dataset (small spins)
  - Optional: decompositions (9j→6j sums) where available
- Add scripts to regenerate references with pinned rules:
  - exact rational mode
  - numeric mode (float) with explicit tolerances

Acceptance criteria:
- Tests compare against golden datasets without network access.

### T3 — Cross-verification matrix (what checks what)
Build a table mapping:
- Formula → Implementation A → Implementation B → identity/invariant

Example checks:
- Closed form vs SymPy (`wigner_6j`, `wigner_9j`)
- Racah-summation implementation vs SymPy
- Recurrence reconstruction vs direct evaluation
- Generating functional coefficients vs direct Wigner values

Acceptance criteria:
- At least 2 independent routes validate each key claim.

### T4 — Numerical stability & UQ hooks
Actions:
- Add a simple, consistent UQ protocol:
  - sweep over spin ranges
  - track condition numbers / determinant stability (for generating functional)
  - compare rational vs numeric evaluation

Acceptance criteria:
- A “stability report” script produces a CSV/JSON summary.

### T5 — Cross-repo integration harness
Actions:
- Create a unified “hub” repo that can:
  - import from `su2-3nj-closedform`, `su2-3nj-uniform-closed-form`, `su2-3nj-recurrences`, `su2-3nj-generating-functional`, `su2-node-matrix-elements`
  - run an end-to-end validation command (single entrypoint)
- Add higher-n spot checks (e.g., 12j/15j) using high precision (mpmath 50 dps) where applicable.

Acceptance criteria:
- One command runs the full validation suite + produces a summary report.

---

## 2) Paper bundling / publication tasks

### P1 — Decide bundling (2–3 papers) vs single JMP draft
Suggested 3-paper arc:
1) Closed-form + uniform hypergeometric representation
2) Finite recurrences + algorithms/stability
3) Generating functionals + arbitrary-valence node matrix elements

Alternative single paper title:
- “Unified Closed-Form Representations and Generating Functionals for SU(2) 3n-j Recoupling Coefficients.”

Acceptance criteria:
- A single outline exists with section allocation and cross-references.

### P2 — Master LaTeX merge
Actions:
- Identify source LaTeX masters (per repo):
  - closed-form: `A Closed-Form Hypergeometric Product Formula for General SU(2) 3nj Recoupling Coefficients.tex`
  - uniform: `Universal Closed-Form Hypergeometric Representation of SU(2) 3nj Symbols.tex`
  - recurrences: `Closed-Form Finite Recurrences for SU(2) 3nj Symbols.tex`
  - generating functional: `A Universal Generating Functional for SU(2) 3nj Symbols.tex`
  - node matrix elements: `Closed-Form Matrix Elements for Arbitrary-Valence SU(2) Nodes via Generating Functionals.tex`
- Create a master tree (new repo recommended, e.g. `su2-3nj-series-paper/`) with:
  - shared macros
  - shared bibliography
  - appendices for proofs and code

Acceptance criteria:
- One `latexmk` command builds the full PDF.

### P3 — Literature integration (priors)
Actions:
- Add a “Related Work” section with BibTeX entries and explicit positioning.
- Integrate already-downloaded priors in `energy/papers/related/` into the bib.

Acceptance criteria:
- 5–10 relevant priors cited in intro + comparisons.

### P4 — Validation section + tables
Actions:
- Add a dedicated validation section:
  - known values (3j/6j)
  - random small-spin sampling (6j/9j)
  - identities (Biedenharn–Elliott, orthogonality)
  - recurrence cross-checks

Acceptance criteria:
- Tables/figures are reproducibly generated by scripts committed in repos.
