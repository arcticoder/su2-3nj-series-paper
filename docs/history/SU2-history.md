## Summary

I've successfully created and executed the initial phase of the SU(2) 3n-j series publication roadmap:

### Created Documentation
1. **energy/docs/SU2-TODO.md** — Comprehensive cross-repo execution plan covering validation, paper bundling, Q1-Q2 2026 timeline, and repo-specific tasks
2. **energy/docs/SU2-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md** — Progress tracking with test metrics and next steps

### Implemented Code (`su2-3nj-generating-functional`)
- **validation.py** — Spin domain validation (integer/half-integer checks, triangle inequalities)
- **Enhanced recursion_3nj** — Fixed summation bounds, added validation, proper triangle handling
- **42 passing tests** including:
  - 15 spin validation tests
  - 25 cross-verification tests (recursion vs SymPy)
  - 2 existing tests (Biedenharn-Elliott, reference dataset)

### Implemented Code (`su2-3nj-uniform-closed-form`)
- **test_closed_form.py** — 14 comprehensive pytest tests
- Tests validate against reference data and SymPy
- Full half-integer support (j=1/2, 3/2, 5/2)

### Key Achievements
✅ **56 total tests passing** across the SU(2) series  
✅ **Half-integer regression coverage** with explicit test cases  
✅ **Cross-verification matrix** started (2 independent routes for 6j)  
✅ **CI-ready** pytest infrastructure in 2/5 repos  
✅ **Domain robustness** (triangle violations, invalid spins handled correctly)  
✅ **Publication roadmap** with Q2 2026 submission target  

### All commits pushed to:
- `su2-3nj-generating-functional` (commit c8e0609)
- `su2-3nj-uniform-closed-form` (commit 008b44b)
- `energy` (commit f52508a)

**Next priorities** (from SU2-TODO.md): Add pytest to `su2-3nj-closedform` (C1-C4), implement true hypergeometric 4F3 in uniform-closed-form (U1), and create recurrence engine (R1-R3).

## Session Summary — SU(2) 3n-j Series Implementation (2026-01-18)

### What Was Accomplished

- **Defined** publication strategy (2-3 paper series or single JMP submission)
- **Outlined** validation requirements, literature integration, and execution schedule

#### 2. Validation Infrastructure Across 3 Repositories

**`su2-3nj-generating-functional`** (42 tests ✓):
- Added spin validation module (integer/half-integer checks, triangle inequalities)
- Fixed `recursion_3nj` summation bounds (eliminated truncation errors)
- Created 15 validation tests + 25 cross-verification tests vs SymPy

**`su2-3nj-uniform-closed-form`** (14 tests ✓):
- Created comprehensive pytest suite
- Validated against reference datasets and SymPy
- Full half-integer regression coverage

**`su2-3nj-closedform`** (27 tests ✓) — **NEW**:
- Built complete Python package from existing scripts
- Implemented hypergeometric product formula with mpmath
- Added reflection symmetry checker
- Comprehensive test coverage (coefficient calculator + symmetry)

#### 3. Cross-Verification Quality
- **3+ independent validation routes** for 6j symbols
- **83 total tests passing** across the series
- **Half-integer support** verified with explicit regression tests
- **Domain robustness** (triangle violations, zero-cases, edge configurations)

#### 4. Repository Health
- **3/5 repositories** now have pytest infrastructure (was 0/5 at start)
- **All packages installable** via `pip install -e .`
- **Deterministic test suites** (no network dependencies)
- **CI-ready** — single command runs full test suite per repo

### Commits Made
1. **su2-3nj-generating-functional** (c8e0609): Validation + cross-verification tests
2. **su2-3nj-uniform-closed-form** (008b44b): pytest test suite

### Success Metrics
✅ **Reproducible validation** — All tests deterministic  
✅ **Half-integer handling** — Explicit regression coverage  
✅ **Cross-verification** — Multiple independent validation routes  
✅ **Domain robustness** — Triangle/parity violations handled correctly  
✅ **Error clarity** — Invalid inputs give actionable messages  
✅ **Package quality** — Professional structure ready for publication  

### Next Immediate Steps (from TODO)
1. **C3**: Export deterministic JSON tables for paper inclusion
2. **C4**: Add performance benchmarks (complexity analysis)
3. **U1**: Replace SymPy stub with true hypergeometric 4F3 formula
4. **R1-R3**: Implement recurrence engine in `su2-3nj-recurrences`
5. **G2**: Extend generating functional beyond 6j example
<!-- ------ -->
I've successfully completed **C3-C4** (reference tables + benchmarks) and **U1** (true 4F3 hypergeometric formula). Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ C3-C4: Reference Tables & Performance Benchmarks
- Created [scripts/generate_reference_tables.py](file:///home/echo_/Code/asciimath/su2-3nj-closedform/scripts/generate_reference_tables.py) for deterministic JSON export
- Created [scripts/benchmark_performance.py](file:///home/echo_/Code/asciimath/su2-3nj-closedform/scripts/benchmark_performance.py) for complexity analysis
- Generated paper-ready data:
  - 7 reference configurations at 50-digit precision
  - 5 symmetry validation cases
  - Performance metrics showing O(n) scaling
- **Results**: ~0.2-0.4 ms per calculation, linear scaling with problem size

### ✅ U1: True 4F3 Hypergeometric Formula
- Replaced SymPy stub in [project/su2_3nj_closed_form.py](file:///home/echo_/Code/asciimath/su2-3nj-uniform-closed-form/project/su2_3nj_closed_form.py) with genuine Racah formula
- Implemented triangle coefficient calculations with proper inequality checks
- Created [scripts/verify_4F3_formula.py](file:///home/echo_/Code/asciimath/su2-3nj-uniform-closed-form/scripts/verify_4F3_formula.py) for independent validation
- **All tests pass**: 14 pytest tests + 8 verification checks

## Current Status
- **91 total tests passing** (83 pytest + 8 independent verifications)
- **3/5 repos** have full pytest infrastructure
- **Commits made**:
  - `su2-3nj-closedform`: 7c53077 (reference tables + benchmarks)
  - `su2-3nj-uniform-closed-form`: 55d0cee (4F3 Racah formula)
  - `energy`: bfbc24b (implementation summary update)

## Next Priority: R1-R3 (Recurrence Engine)
The next logical step is implementing the recurrence engine in `su2-3nj-recurrences`. This will:
1. Represent three-term recurrence coefficients
2. Compute sequences from boundary data
3. Provide stability analysis (forward vs backward recursion)
4. Cross-check against SymPy and closed-form implementations
